# Bee-Wing-Pattern-Classification-using-CNN
This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of bee wings into 18 different categories based on visual patterns. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of bee wing images and evaluated using performance metrics. A Streamlit app is integrated to allow real-time predictions on new images.
